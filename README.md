# SyMon

SyMon is a system monitoring tool that will monitor CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. This simple CLI tool is built using Go. The purpose of SyMon is to further enhance my skills using Go as well as to better understand the standard Go library.

Thank you to mackerelio for their go-osstat library. This helped me understand how to structure my own library, and also understand what is happening under the hood.
